# Spam-Email-Classifier
Creating a classification model to classify an email as Spam or Non-Spam

In this project I utilize feature engineering, logistic regression and cross validation in order to build a classification model. You can also expect:
- Feature engineering with text data
- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
